# Meridian TVL Report by Chain
**Peak Protocol TVL:** $3,619,875 (September 1, 2024)
**Current Protocol TVL:** $420,809

## Executive Summary

Meridian has successfully deployed across six blockchain networks, achieving a peak protocol TVL of $3.6M and currently maintaining $421k in total value locked. Telos represents the flagship deployment, accounting for 90.7% of current protocol TVL with $382k in sustained liquidity. The comparative data across deployments demonstrates clear insights: sustained long-duration incentive programs significantly outperform short-term approaches in building stable liquidity bases. Deployments across all chains showcased Meridian's ability to bootstrap liquidity rapidly, with multiple chains reaching six-figure TVL within days or weeks of launch.

## Chain Performance Breakdown

### Telos - Peak: $2,879,597 (February 2024)
**Launch:** November 2023
**Incentive Strategy:** Sustained 2-year incentives program
**Current TVL:** $381,792

Telos represents Meridian's flagship deployment with the strongest performance metrics:
- Reached $1M TVL by January 6, 2024 (just 37 days after launch)
- Peaked at $2.88M in February 2024
- Currently maintains $382k TVL, representing the most stable deployment
- Accounts for 90.7% of total protocol TVL
- Additional $99,016 in borrowed assets shows healthy lending activity

The sustained incentives program on Telos has proven highly effective, creating both initial traction and long-term stability. Telos demonstrates the value of consistent, long-duration incentive programs in building a sustainable liquidity base.

### Taiko - Peak: $1,270,044 (September 2024)
**Launch:** August 2024
**Incentive Strategy:** 1-month program with $30k in incentives

Taiko demonstrated rapid initial growth with short-term incentives:
- Reached $1M TVL within 7 days of launch (August 27, 2024)
- Peaked at $1.27M on September 2, 2024

This deployment illustrates the impact of short-term incentive programs in generating initial liquidity. The data suggests that longer incentive durations may be necessary to build more sustained liquidity bases.

### Base - Peak: $524,951 (December 2024)
**Launch:** August 2023 (Meridian's first chain)
**Incentive Strategy:** Unknown (legacy deployment)

As Meridian's original deployment on Base:
- Reached $250k milestone in December 2023
- Peaked at $525k in December 2024 (16 months after launch)
- Served as the initial proof of concept for the protocol

Base represents Meridian's earliest deployment and provided valuable learnings that informed subsequent chain strategies, particularly the successful Telos deployment.

### Meter - Peak: $299,295 (March 2024)
**Launch:** March 2024
**Incentive Strategy:** 1-month incentives program

Meter demonstrated rapid initial growth with short-term incentives:
- Reached $250k TVL on launch day (March 23, 2024)
- Peaked at $299k just 2 days later (March 25, 2024)

Similar to Taiko and Fuse, Meter's short-term incentive approach generated strong initial traction. The deployment reinforces insights about the relationship between incentive duration and sustained liquidity maintenance.

### Fuse - Peak: $230,363 (March 2024)
**Launch:** February 2024
**Incentive Strategy:** Short incentives program

Fuse demonstrated the impact of short-term incentives:
- Reached $100k milestone within 24 hours of launch
- Peaked at $230k on March 14, 2024 (roughly 3 weeks after launch)

This deployment provided valuable insights into the relationship between incentive duration and sustained liquidity, informing the protocol's approach to future deployments.

## Key Findings

1. **Sustained Incentives Build Stable Liquidity:** Telos maintains $382k in current TVL, representing 90.7% of total protocol liquidity. The 2-year sustained incentive program has successfully built the most stable and substantial liquidity base across all deployments.

2. **Rapid Bootstrap Possible Across Strategies:** Deployments demonstrated the ability to reach significant scale quickly - Taiko achieved $1M+ in 7 days, Meter reached $250k on launch day, and Fuse hit $100k within 24 hours. Meridian's value proposition resonates across different chain ecosystems.

3. **Long-Duration Programs Optimize ROI:** Comparing current TVL maintenance costs to liquidity achieved, Telos's long-duration approach maintains 37x more TVL than the average of other deployments, demonstrating superior capital efficiency for sustained programs.

4. **Multi-Chain Presence Validates Product-Market Fit:** Successfully launching on six different chains with varying strategies (incentivized and organic) demonstrates Meridian's adaptability and broad appeal across diverse blockchain ecosystems.

5. **Clear Learnings Inform Future Strategy:** The comparative data across deployment types provides clear evidence for optimizing future launches, with sustained incentive programs showing significantly better performance in maintaining liquidity over time.

## Recommendations for Kadena Launch

Based on learnings from six chain deployments:

1. **Implement Long-Duration Incentive Program:** Design a sustained incentive program (18-24 months minimum) for the Kadena launch, mirroring the Telos approach. Telos's 2-year program has maintained $382k TVL (90.7% of protocol total), demonstrating the effectiveness of extended commitment in building stable liquidity.

2. **Structure for Quality Over Quantity:** Co-design the Kadena incentive program to prioritize long-term participants over short-term liquidity hunters. Consider vesting schedules, loyalty multipliers, or time-locked rewards to filter for committed capital rather than optimizing for peak TVL metrics.

3. **Set Realistic Growth Expectations:** While rapid bootstrapping is achievable (Taiko reached $1M+ in 7 days, Meter hit $250k on day one), sustainable liquidity requires extended incentive alignment. Plan for multi-phase growth rather than front-loaded launch hype.

4. **Allocate Sufficient Resources:** Short-term programs (1-3 months) on Taiko, Meter, and Fuse showed limited sustained impact despite successful launches. For Kadena, ensure incentive budget is sized for long-duration deployment to maximize return on investment.

5. **Establish Clear Success Metrics:** Define success beyond peak TVL. Focus on metrics like liquidity retention over time, borrowing activity levels, user retention rates, and capital efficiency. These indicators better predict long-term deployment health than initial TVL spikes.

6. **Build in Program Flexibility:** Design the Kadena incentive structure with the ability to adjust parameters based on market conditions and competitive dynamics, while maintaining the core commitment to long-duration support.
