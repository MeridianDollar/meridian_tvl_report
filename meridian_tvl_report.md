# Meridian TVL Report by Chain
**Report Date:** October 14, 2025
**Total Protocol TVL:** $420,809

## Executive Summary

Meridian currently maintains TVL across six active chains, with Telos representing the dominant deployment at over 90% of total protocol TVL. The data reveals a clear correlation between sustained incentive programs and TVL retention, with significant differences in performance between incentivized and organic deployments.

## Chain Performance Breakdown

### Telos - $381,792 (90.7% of total TVL)
**Launch:** November 2023
**Incentive Strategy:** Sustained 2-year incentives program

Telos represents Meridian's flagship deployment with the strongest performance metrics:
- Reached $1M TVL by January 6, 2024 (just 37 days after launch)
- Maintained consistently high TVL throughout 2024-2025
- Current TVL of $381,792 demonstrates strong retention
- Additional $99,016 in borrowed assets shows healthy lending activity

The sustained incentives program on Telos has proven highly effective, creating both initial traction and long-term stability. This deployment serves as a benchmark for the impact of consistent, long-duration incentive programs.

### Taraxa - $13,039 (3.1% of total TVL)
**Launch:** December 2024
**Incentive Strategy:** No incentives

Despite launching without any incentive program, Taraxa has achieved notable organic growth:
- Reached $1M milestone (though TVL has since normalized)
- Current TVL of $13,039 represents genuine organic demand
- $21,077 in borrowed assets indicates active lending usage
- Second-highest active TVL among non-incentivized chains

This deployment demonstrates that Meridian can attract organic users, though at significantly lower volumes than incentivized chains.

### Taiko - $10,379 (2.5% of total TVL)
**Launch:** August 2024
**Incentive Strategy:** 1-month program with $30k in incentives

Taiko exemplifies the "incentive spike" pattern:
- Rapid initial growth, reaching $1M TVL by August 27, 2024 (7 days after launch)
- Sharp decline post-incentive period
- Current TVL of $10,379 (99% decrease from peak)
- Minimal borrowed assets ($4,888) suggest reduced activity

The short-term incentive program successfully bootstrapped initial liquidity but failed to create sustainable TVL retention. Most liquidity departed after rewards ended, highlighting the importance of incentive duration and alignment.

### Base - $5,995 (1.4% of total TVL)
**Launch:** August 2023 (Meridian's first chain)
**Status:** Appears to be legacy/initial deployment

As Meridian's original deployment on Base:
- Reached $250k milestone in December 2023
- Significant decline to current $5,995
- Minimal current activity
- Likely superseded by Telos as the primary deployment

### Meter - $6,100 (1.4% of total TVL)
**Launch:** March 2024
**Incentive Strategy:** No incentives

Meter achieved impressive early growth without incentives:
- Reached $250k TVL on launch day (March 23, 2024)
- Sharp subsequent decline to current $6,100
- $2,440 in borrowed assets
- Pattern suggests initial enthusiasm that wasn't sustained

The rapid initial growth followed by decline suggests Meter may have had organic community interest that wasn't maintained, possibly due to broader market conditions or competition.

### Fuse - $3,499 (0.8% of total TVL)
**Launch:** February 2024
**Incentive Strategy:** Short incentives program

Fuse showed modest performance despite incentives:
- Reached $100k milestone within 24 hours of launch
- Unable to sustain growth beyond early spike
- Current TVL of $3,499 indicates limited retention
- Minimal borrowed assets ($514)

The short incentive program on Fuse generated initial interest but proved insufficient for long-term retention, performing similarly to chains without any incentives.

## Key Findings

1. **Incentive Duration Matters:** Telos's 2-year sustained incentives ($381k TVL retained) vastly outperformed Taiko's 1-month program ($10k retained) despite Taiko's higher peak.

2. **Organic Growth Is Challenging:** Chains without incentives (Taraxa, Meter) achieved modest TVL ($13k-$6k) compared to sustained incentive programs, though they demonstrate genuine product-market fit.

3. **Short-Term Incentives Have Limited Impact:** Both Fuse (short incentives) and Taiko (1-month incentives) experienced similar post-program declines, performing only marginally better than non-incentivized chains.

4. **Lending Activity Correlates with TVL:** Telos maintains the highest borrowed assets ($99k), while other chains show minimal lending activity, suggesting TVL depth drives utilization.

## Recommendations

Based on this analysis:
- Future deployments should prioritize sustained, long-duration incentive programs (6+ months minimum)
- Short-term incentive campaigns (<3 months) may not justify their cost given limited retention
- Organic growth is possible but requires significantly longer timelines and community building
- Consider extending or implementing incentives on promising organic chains (Taraxa) to accelerate growth
