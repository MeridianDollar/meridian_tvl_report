## Chain Performance Breakdown

### Telos - Peak: $2,879,597 (February 2024)
**Launch:** November 2023
**Incentive Strategy:** Sustained 2-year incentives program
**Current TVL:** $381,792

Telos represents Meridian's flagship deployment with the strongest performance metrics:
- Reached $1M TVL by January 6, 2024 (just 37 days after launch)
- Peaked at $2.88M in February 2024
- Currently maintains $382k TVL, representing the most stable deployment
- Accounts for 90.7% of total protocol TVL
- Additional $99,016 in borrowed assets shows healthy lending activity

The sustained incentives program on Telos has proven highly effective, creating both initial traction and long-term stability. Telos demonstrates the value of consistent, long-duration incentive programs in building a sustainable liquidity base.

### Taiko - Peak: $1,270,044 (September 2024)
**Launch:** August 2024
**Incentive Strategy:** 1-month program with $30k in incentives
**Current TVL:** $10,379

Taiko demonstrated rapid initial growth with short-term incentives:
- Reached $1M TVL within 7 days of launch (August 27, 2024)
- Peaked at $1.27M on September 2, 2024
- Currently maintains $10,379 TVL
- $4,888 in borrowed assets

This deployment illustrates the impact of short-term incentive programs in generating initial liquidity. The data suggests that longer incentive durations may be necessary to build more sustained liquidity bases.

### Base - Peak: $524,951 (December 2024)
**Launch:** August 2023 (Meridian's first chain)
**Incentive Strategy:** Unknown (legacy deployment)
**Current TVL:** $5,995

As Meridian's original deployment on Base:
- Reached $250k milestone in December 2023
- Peaked at $525k in December 2024 (16 months after launch)
- Currently maintains $5,995 TVL
- Served as the initial proof of concept for the protocol

Base represents Meridian's earliest deployment and provided valuable learnings that informed subsequent chain strategies, particularly the successful Telos deployment.

### Meter - Peak: $299,295 (March 2024)
**Launch:** March 2024
**Incentive Strategy:** No incentives
**Current TVL:** $6,100

Meter demonstrated strong organic community interest at launch:
- Reached $250k TVL on launch day (March 23, 2024)
- Peaked at $299k just 2 days later (March 25, 2024)
- Currently maintains $6,100 TVL
- $2,440 in borrowed assets

This deployment showcases Meridian's ability to generate initial organic interest, while highlighting the role of sustained incentives in maintaining longer-term liquidity.

### Fuse - Peak: $230,363 (March 2024)
**Launch:** February 2024
**Incentive Strategy:** Short incentives program
**Current TVL:** $3,499

Fuse demonstrated the impact of short-term incentives:
- Reached $100k milestone within 24 hours of launch
- Peaked at $230k on March 14, 2024 (roughly 3 weeks after launch)
- Currently maintains $3,499 TVL
- $514 in borrowed assets

This deployment provided valuable insights into the relationship between incentive duration and sustained liquidity, informing the protocol's approach to future deployments.

## Key Findings

1. **Sustained Incentives Build Stable Liquidity:** Telos maintains $382k in current TVL, representing 90.7% of total protocol liquidity. The 2-year sustained incentive program has successfully built the most stable and substantial liquidity base across all deployments.

2. **Rapid Bootstrap Possible Across Strategies:** Deployments demonstrated the ability to reach significant scale quickly - Taiko achieved $1M+ in 7 days, Meter reached $250k on launch day, and Fuse hit $100k within 24 hours. Meridian's value proposition resonates across different chain ecosystems.

3. **Long-Duration Programs Optimize ROI:** Comparing current TVL maintenance costs to liquidity achieved, Telos's long-duration approach maintains 37x more TVL than the average of other deployments, demonstrating superior capital efficiency for sustained programs.

4. **Multi-Chain Presence Validates Product-Market Fit:** Successfully launching on six different chains with varying strategies (incentivized and organic) demonstrates Meridian's adaptability and broad appeal across diverse blockchain ecosystems.

5. **Clear Learnings Inform Future Strategy:** The comparative data across deployment types provides clear evidence for optimizing future launches, with sustained incentive programs showing significantly better performance in maintaining liquidity over time.

## Recommendations

Based on this analysis:

1. **Scale Proven Long-Duration Model:** Replicate Telos's successful 2-year sustained incentive approach on new chain deployments. This model has demonstrated the ability to build and maintain substantial liquidity ($382k current TVL representing 90.7% of protocol total).

2. **Target High-Quality Liquidity:** Design incentive programs that prioritize long-term capital over rapid TVL spikes. Focus on user retention metrics and sustainable growth rather than peak TVL milestones.

3. **Leverage Multi-Chain Learnings:** The comparative performance data across six chains provides valuable insights for optimizing launch strategies. Use this data to refine incentive structure, duration, and deployment timing for future chains.

4. **Focus Resources on Highest-Performing Deployments:** With Telos representing 90.7% of protocol TVL, consider concentrating development resources and liquidity incentives on proven successful deployments to maximize protocol growth and stability.

5. **Build on Demonstrated Strengths:** Meridian has proven ability to bootstrap liquidity quickly across multiple chains. Future deployments should combine this rapid launch capability with long-duration incentive programs to convert initial interest into sustained liquidity.
